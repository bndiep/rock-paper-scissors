Today is 13 January 2020. We have finally made it to the Rock Paper Scissors project!

Everything is meant to played from the browser console.

I will be making several functions that accept parameters to ensure that the game is playable.

This game is meant to be played with the computer, so I am assuming the computer will play some random return.

What I want to get most out of this project is the ability to write my code cleanly and concisely.

Let's hope that the short break I had from studying will not effect my ability to remember how to write a function.
